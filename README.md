# PMD
Plex Media Downloader (Plex Bot / Mr. Plex)

## Goal:
  * Create an accessible means for anyone who wants to to contribute media to a Plex server
  * Add as much automation to the proccess as possible
  * Set and forget functionality
  * No need to sit around waiting for loading screens, just queue up what you want and let the server take care of it
    * All the downloads are done server side, so there are no large data transfers from client to server

## Plans:
  * Update the GitHub README.md file:
    * [x] This is way out of date...
    * [x] Instead of updating it I just removed all the irrelevant information
  * For more plans, see [here][https://github.com/LikeToAccess/PMD/blob/main/TODO.md]
